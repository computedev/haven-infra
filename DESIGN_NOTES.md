## B2 — idempotency key

State exactly what key your `cost_tag_check.py` uses to decide whether two resources in the
same run are "the same" for dedup purposes, and why running it twice against an unchanged
plan file produces identical output and exit code without the script keeping any record
between runs. Use the word "idempotency" in your explanation.
